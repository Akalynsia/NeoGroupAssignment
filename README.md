Description: I have prepared this project for NeoGroup assignment and it features image slider, a step-by-step guide for users, interactive cards and responsive layout for other devices.
I have used HTML, CSS ,and Javascript for this project. HTML for its structure, CSS for its layout, and JavaScript for slider and animations.
The website features a responsive design for various sized including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It has a image slider to welcome users and show different offers the casino offers. I have added interactive elements such as hovers, flip cards, and animated buttons.
It instructs users to how to register, deposit, and start playing on cards with small animations on them. I used CSS for some animations and transitions.
The website can be improved by adding more animations for an engaging user experience. Can implement a backend for user authentications. Improve accesibility and performance.

I have started project with a Hero Slider, I have used JavaScript for slider but added background images with CSS so I could add some other features such as logo and text on slider. I have put logo and login links on a slider instead of making a new header because I thought it
could look bad to have a different color than slider. After slider I have prepared a section for step-by-step guide and cards. I decided to use a background image because I thought since slider is so colorful white didn't seem quite good for me. I have added 6 cards on section
and decided to continue with transparent backgrounds for those cards. I added animations to register and start playing when you mouse over them. They go from idle animation to another one. For step-by-step guide I have used JavaScript to make them appear with 0.5 secs delayed
from each other. After that I finished the cards. When you mouse over the card with title it gives description. I didnt want to use JavaScript here so I did it with CSS using transition 180.
